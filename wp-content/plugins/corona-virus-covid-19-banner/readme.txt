== Upgrade Notice == 

No notice at this time.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin with a sole purpose of allowing website owners a quick way to add a COVID-19 notice to their website. This free plugin is intended to provide a stop-gap solution, and does not attempt to compete with more full-featured "banner" plugins. 

This plugin now offers additional data display features by using the shortcode <code>[covid-data]</code>. See Screenshot 4 to see how it works.

When using the Live Data option, this plugin communicates with an API. This API does not send any personal or identifiable information. Data provided by Johns Hopkins CSSE. Privacy Policy: https://covid19api.com/privacy-policy.html

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who would use this plugin? =

WordPress websites that need to display notices regarding COVID-19, or those who want to display the latest COVID-19 data (confirmed, recovered, deaths).

= Why is my notice not displaying properly/not at all? =

If you have a floating menu, or a complex WordPress theme, the Banner setting may not work well. Try using the Overlay or Leaderboard setting instead.

= Who can I contact for support? =

Send an email to support@orchestrated.ca. Make sure to include the word "SUPPORT" in the subject of the email.

= Why choose Orchestrated WordPress plugins? =

We're a digital agency – so we too understand how annoying it is to find the perfect plugin for your client – only to discover that it's riddled with call to actions, off-brand styling, error and other messages that distracts away from the seamless experience you're trying to offer. As such, we develop plugins that don't invade your dashboard or dashboard menus, and function as part of the overall WordPress experience.
